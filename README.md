# Openai DALL'E

---

A simple project to make sense on how to integrate **DALL'E** to an existing project

## Start the project with

> python3 main.py

## Disclaimer

1. install openai with `pip3 install openai`
2. bug: the json file will be created 2 times due to the import of the `response` variable into **the convert module**
